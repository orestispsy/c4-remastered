<h1><br>💠</br> Description</h1>
 <div align=center>
<br>The story goes like this : I was creating DOM elements with Javascript and started building shapes, styling with CSS Grid. At some point, my screen
        started looking similar to the Board of Connect 4, the old Game for kids I've made with jQuery about a year ago. I decided to move on
        and add functionalities. After a few hundreds of lines I came up with this version ! Made with love for the game & pure Vanilla JS.</bt>
